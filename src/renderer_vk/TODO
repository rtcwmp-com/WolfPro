2/16/25 disconnect should shutdown the renderer
loading map after a map is already loaded causes infinite loading 

only call CmdBindVertexBuffers when the buffer bindings actually change

shader r_cache
  disable backup
  use hashmap for shader text

fix loading screen black image
proper upload manager for textures (linear allocation + CPU waits are moved out)
  - add wait semaphore to the render submission in EndFrame so that textures are guaranteed to be in a valid state when used
  - use command buffers in a ring buffer (array of { HCommandBuffer buffer; uint64_t signaledValue; } + int index)
    - signaledValue is initialized to 0 during renderer init
    - pick next command buffer, do CPU wait, continue as usual
    - combine the CPU waits when rewinding the upload buffer
dynamic lights

add support for (and use) an extra clip plane for portal/mirror views

remove r_ignoreglerrors r_drawBuffer and stereo
redo com_frame/rhi_endframe sleep mechanism _mm_pause busy loop
