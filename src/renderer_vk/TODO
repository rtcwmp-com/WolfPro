2/16/25 disconnect should shutdown the renderer
loading map after a map is already loaded causes infinite loading 
some mp_ice trees have wrong vertex attributes (black color)
 - need shader override textures/tree/pine_trunk_m02.tga [texture] 128x256 R8G8B8A8_UNORM


shader r_cache
  disable backup
  use hashmap for shader text


why is R_LightScaleTexture not applied to non-mipmapped textures that are not rescaled

dynamic lights
 - frustum culling


R_DlightSurface( msurface_t *surf, int dlightBits (boolean) ) -> mask 
R_AddWorldSurface( msurface_t *surf, shader_t *shader, int dlightBits (boolean)) 
R_AddDrawSurf( surf->data, shader, surf->fogIndex, dlightBits (boolean))


tess.dlightBits


what happens when this part is uncommented? 
backEnd.refdef.floatTime = originalTime; // - backEnd.currentEntity->e.shaderTime; // JPW NERVE pulled this to match q3ta

add support for (and use) an extra clip plane for portal/mirror views
fog

MSAA + alpha2coverage
remove r_cache/r_cacheshaders
remove r_measureoverdraw
remove r_ignoreglerrors r_drawBuffer and stereo
redo com_frame/rhi_endframe sleep mechanism _mm_pause busy loop
remove R_GammaCorrect s_gammatable

vid_restart variations:
    vid_restart -> full
    full-screen toggle -> full
    CGame load/unload -> partial
    Client exit -> full
