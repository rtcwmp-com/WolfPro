2/16/25 disconnect should shutdown the renderer
loading map after a map is already loaded causes infinite loading 
some mp_ice trees have wrong vertex attributes (black color)
 - need shader override textures/tree/pine_trunk_m02.tga [texture] 128x256 R8G8B8A8_UNORM


shader r_cache
  disable backup
  use hashmap for shader text


why is R_LightScaleTexture not applied to non-mipmapped textures that are not rescaled

dynamic lights
- we need the normal vector to properly avoid lighting back faces
    - if we decide to only use exactly 1 light (or very small amount) per surface, then we can shade in object space and not push any new matrix data to the GPU:
      - the normal vector is already in object-space, so no extra transformation is necessary
      - transform the light position(s) to object space on the CPU and upload through push constants
    - for the fully generic version we can shade in either world-space or view-space
      either way we need to pass down at least 1 extra matrix per draw call through a new uniform buffer
      (the inverse-transpose of the model/model-view matrix)
- move the quick test code from generic2 to generic so that we can light up e.g. dropped weapons with a dynamite to make sure all transformations are correct

add support for (and use) an extra clip plane for portal/mirror views

MSAA + alpha2coverage
remove r_cache/r_cacheshaders
remove r_measureoverdraw
remove r_ignoreglerrors r_drawBuffer and stereo
redo com_frame/rhi_endframe sleep mechanism _mm_pause busy loop
remove R_GammaCorrect s_gammatable

vid_restart variations:
    vid_restart -> full
    full-screen toggle -> full
    CGame load/unload -> partial
    Client exit -> full
